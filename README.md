## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
To support small and marginal farmers in India, we propose an AI-powered, multilingual smart agriculture advisory platform accessible via a mobile app and chatbot. This platform provides real-time, personalized guidance on crop selection, soil health, fertilizer use, pest and disease management, weather alerts, and market prices. By analyzing soil data, historical crop patterns, and local weather, the system suggests optimal crops, sowing and harvesting times, and sustainable farming practices. Farmers can upload soil test results or images of affected crops, and AI-driven recommendations guide fertilizer use and pest control. The platform offers regional language and voice support for low-literacy users and works offline in areas with limited connectivity. Market insights help farmers maximize profits, while a feedback mechanism enables continuous improvement of recommendations. Overall, this solution empowers farmers with scientific insights, increases crop yields, reduces costs, encourages sustainable practices, and improves livelihoods, while assisting agricultural agencies and cooperatives in monitoring and supporting local farming communities.

## Technical Approach

The proposed solution will be implemented using a combination of data-driven AI models, mobile technologies, and cloud infrastructure. The platform will collect and analyze soil data, crop history, local weather patterns, and market prices to provide personalized crop advisory and fertilizer recommendations. Farmers can upload images of plants affected by pests or diseases, which will be processed using image recognition algorithms to identify issues and suggest corrective measures. Weather-based predictive alerts will help farmers take timely preventive actions, while market insights guide decisions on crop sales. The system will support regional languages and voice interactions to ensure accessibility for low-literacy users and include offline capabilities for areas with limited connectivity. Continuous feedback from farmers will be collected to refine AI models and improve accuracy over time. Overall, this technical approach ensures real-time, location-specific, and actionable insights that enhance productivity, promote sustainable practices, and improve farmer livelihoods.
